# Michael-Ekstrom-Impressionist-Painter

This program is run through android studio on an Nexus 10 tablet emulator, using the Marshmallow SDK. The files should be available in a way that you can create a new project from a remote repository successfully.

I have two special features. The first is a color inversion button, which will invert the RGB values of the current pixel while drawing. The second will flash the base image up as the background of the drawing space, so you can quickly check where you are in the image before getting back to drawing.
